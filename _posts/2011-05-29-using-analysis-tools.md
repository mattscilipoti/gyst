title: Day 13 - Learning a Smidgen About Analysis Tools

---

Google Analytics
----------------

Saturday: 0 visits   
Today:   40 visits,  2 from Russia?

Nice to see that someone is looking.

WebMaster Tools
----------------

Identified a couple crawl errors.  A page was renamed and I had bad relative
links.

There were no keywords listed for my site.  I investigated a little and
it looks like I need to submit a Sitemap.  Atom/RSS feed is an option, so I submitted that.  We'll see.

Feedburner
-----------

This shows that I have one subscriber.  woot!   
There is some information about "Reach".  They are trying to
discriminate between subscriptions and engagement.  I'll keep an eye on
that and read more if it changes.

Disqus
------

No comments.

A Lot to Learn
---------------

I'm pretty new to these tools.  Each link I click on leads me to more.
Feedburner has FeedFlare, Socializer, and some connection with AdSense.
Google Analytics has a new Intelligence report that looks for statistical
variations.   
My first concerns are identifying problems and ensuring people can find it.  For now, it looks like I should focus on webmaster tools from google.
