Readme Driven Development
-------------------------

2 Days for a README?  Sure enough.  This was, after all, during Rails/BohConf 2011.  

I was also experimenting with [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).  I played around with a few different usage ideas and settled on the idea of "selective requires".  This allow us to use all of the scripts and libraries or just a select few, by adjusting the require statements.
