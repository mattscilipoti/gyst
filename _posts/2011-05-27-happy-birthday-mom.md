The die is cast.  I released gyst to [rubygems (v
0.0.2)](https://rubygems.org/gems/gyst) and
emailed my friends and family.   
Onward to DbNull.

Install
--------
**NOTE:** in order to use the bash scripts, you must use the `--no-wrappers` argument.   

From rubygems:
    gem install gyst --no-wrappers
Locally:
    gem install pkg/gyst-0.?.?.gem --no-wrappers

It's been fun.  And yes, it really is my Mom's birtday.   
In a way, this really is a great present.

Thanks for everything Mom.
