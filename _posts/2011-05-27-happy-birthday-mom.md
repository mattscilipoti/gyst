The Public Domain
-----------------

The die is cast.  I released gyst to [rubygems (v
0.0.2)](https://rubygems.org/gems/gyst) and
emailed my friends and family.   

Frankly, when I reviewed everything, my first thought was "is that all?" :)   
Then, I realized that it was only evening hours, I had learned a lot about aruba, jekyll, and the stuff blogs are made of, and 
I had recorded it all.  More respect for Strom.

Onward to DbNull.

Install
--------
**NOTE:** in order to use the bash scripts, you must use the `--no-wrappers` argument.   

From rubygems:
    gem install gyst --no-wrappers
Locally:
    gem install pkg/gyst-0.?.?.gem --no-wrappers

It's been fun.  And yes, it really is my Mom's birthday.   
In a way, this really is a great present.

Thanks for everything Mom.

<br/>
'night.
