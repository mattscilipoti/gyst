Adding Google Analytics
-----------------------

If you have put off adding analytics, head on over to
<http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/> and sign up.  It's cake.  You
just register, paste in your url (mine was
"http://github.com/mattscilipoti/gyst"), and then copy/paste the
generated javascript tag.  No edits necessary.  Pretty soon, google will
see the page has the necessary bits and will start recording info.

Webmaster Tools
----------------

Google also has some [WebMaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home).  Before I used google anaytics, I had to add my sites here to ensure google would find me quickly.  That probably isn't the case, once you have added google analytics -- but it's nice to be safe.   
I set up WebMaster tools to email me if there are issues.  You can also set a preference to automatically create an entry in WebMaster tools whenever you make one in Google Analytics.  Done.

Saving "Contact Me" from spam
-----------------------------

My email adress shows up many places on the web.  I haven't personally
seen problems with spammers (maybe gmail is that good?), but I've heard
about it.  The [first mailto hit on google](http://www.ianr.unl.edu/internet/mailto.html) recommends I use something other than mailto on my web page, to reduce spam.

I found a mail cloaker widget at <http://lensco.be/projects/widgets/>.
Entered my info.  Copy/Paste.  Cloaked email.


morn'n.
