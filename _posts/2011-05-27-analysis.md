Adding Google Analytics
-----------------------

If you have put off adding analytics, head on over to
<http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/> and sign up.  It's cake.  You
just register, paste in your url (mine was
"http://github.com/mattscilipoti/gyst"), and then copy/paste the
generated javascript tag.  No edits necessary.  Pretty soon, google will
see the page has the necessary bits and will start recording info.

Webmaster Tools
----------------

Google also has some [WebMaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home).  Before I used google anaytics, I had to add my sites here to ensure google would find me quickly.  That probably isn't the case, once you have added google analytics -- but it's nice to be safe.   
I set up WebMaster tools to email me if there are issues.  You can also set a preference to automatically create an entry in WebMaster tools whenever you make one in Google Analytics.  Done.

Saving "Contact Me" from spam
-----------------------------

My email adress shows up many places on the web.  I haven't personally
seen problems with spammers (maybe gmail is that good?), but I've heard
about it.  The [first mailto hit on google](http://www.ianr.unl.edu/internet/mailto.html) recommends I use something other than mailto on my web page, to reduce spam.

I added a email cloaker, then removed it.  I can't imagine that it
really helps.  KISS.  Keep it simple for people to contact me.


Syntax Highlighting with Jekyll and Pygments
--------------------------------------------

Jekyll supports code syntax highlighting, using Pygments.  Instructions
for installation: <https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install>.

Configure jeykll:
{% highlight yaml %}
#_config.yml
pygments: true
{% endhighlight %}

Add highlight tags to your code.  There is no need for the standard code indentation (4 spaces).  In fact, leading spaces may cause issues.
{% literal %}
    {% highlight ruby %}
      # code goes here
    {% endhighlight %}
{% endliteral %}

It supports [many languages](http://pygments.org/languages/) including ruby, cucumber, sh, and yaml.
    pygmentize -L lexers

Pick a style.  
    pygmentize -L styles # lists available styles.
    pygmentize -S <style_goes_here> -f html -a ".highlight" > css/pygments.css

I chose trac:
    pygmentize -S trac -f html -a ".highlight" > css/pygments.css

Of course, you _could_ write your own css file.  There are also helpers
to extract a pygment css file from an html page.

You can find more help at `cheat pygmentize`.

Don't forget to include the stylesheet link to `css/pygments.css` within \<head\> (_layouts/default.html).

Ain't that purdy.


TOC
----

It's time for a Table of Contents.  I'm going to try the Scaled TOC
at <http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html>.

I put the code in javascripts/toc.js and named the function so I can
call it from $(document).ready.

I also move it to the right, reversing the image as well.

In order to move the first header below the github banner, I decreased
the page height and increased the link_top.

The anchor links were not correct on post pages.  They were pointing to
the domain.  I had to add location.pathname.

Some of the heading links were longer that the page.  I tried using
[autoellipsis]( http://pvdspek.github.com/jquery.autoellipsis/), but it
didn't seem to do it.  Went with white-space:nowrap.
